# PostgreSQL Community Database Analysis

## 🗃️ Project Overview
Comprehensive SQL analysis project demonstrating advanced PostgreSQL querying techniques for community council decision-making. The project analyzes community demographics, economic data, population distribution, and fitness center utilization using complex JOINs, aggregations, and analytical functions.

## 🎯 Business Context
This project was designed to support a community council's data-driven decision making across multiple domains including economic planning (fundraising), urban planning (public facility usage), transportation analysis (vehicle ownership), and public health initiatives (fitness center utilization).

## 📊 Database Structure
The Murder Mystery Database contains 7 interconnected tables providing comprehensive community data:

### Core Tables Analyzed
- **`person`** - Community member demographics and addresses
- **`drivers_license`** - Vehicle registration and license information  
- **`income`** - Annual income data linked by SSN
- **`get_fit_now_member`** - Fitness center membership records
- **`get_fit_now_check_in`** - Gym attendance tracking
- **`interview`** - Interview records and statements
- **`facebook_event_checkin`** - Social event participation data

## 🔍 Business Questions Solved

### 1. Transportation & Vehicle Analysis
**Question**: What are the popular car brands in the community?
**Business Impact**: Supports local business development and transportation planning
```sql
SELECT car_make as "Car Brand", 
       COUNT(car_make) as "Number of Cars"
FROM drivers_license
GROUP BY "Car Brand"
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### 2. Economic Demographics for Fundraising
**Question**: Identify top 20 highest earning individuals for fundraising strategy
**Business Impact**: Targeted fundraising approach and donor segmentation
```sql
SELECT name as "Name", 
       address_street_name as "Address", 
       age as "Age", 
       gender as "Gender", 
       car_make as "Car Type", 
       annual_income as "Income"
FROM person as P
LEFT JOIN drivers_license as dl ON P.license_id = dl.id
INNER JOIN income USING(ssn)
ORDER BY 6 DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### 3. Urban Planning & Population Distribution
**Question**: Street-level population analysis for public facility planning
**Business Impact**: Infrastructure development and public service allocation
```sql
SELECT address_street_name as "Street Name", 
       COUNT(name) as "Population"
FROM person
GROUP BY "Street Name"
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### 4. Public Health & Fitness Analytics
**Question A**: Gender distribution in fitness center membership
**Question B**: Membership status breakdown for program planning
**Business Impact**: Health program development and facility capacity planning
```sql
-- Gender Analysis
SELECT gender as "Gender", 
       COUNT(gym.name) as "Population"
FROM get_fit_now_member as gym
LEFT JOIN person as P ON gym.person_id = P.id
FULL JOIN drivers_license as dl ON P.license_id = dl.id
GROUP BY "Gender"
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- Membership Status Analysis  
SELECT membership_status as "Membership Status", 
       COUNT(gym.name) as "Population"
FROM get_fit_now_member as gym
LEFT JOIN person as P ON gym.person_id = P.id
INNER JOIN drivers_license as dl ON P.license_id = dl.id
GROUP BY "Membership Status"
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

## 🛠️ SQL Techniques Demonstrated

### Advanced JOIN Operations
- **LEFT JOIN**: Preserving all records from primary table
- **INNER JOIN**: Exact matching between related tables
- **FULL JOIN**: Comprehensive data inclusion with NULL handling
- **JOIN with USING**: Simplified syntax for common column joins

### Aggregation & Analytical Functions
- **COUNT()**: Population and frequency analysis
- **GROUP BY**: Categorical data summarization
- **ORDER BY**: Result ranking and prioritization
- **LIMIT**: Top-N analysis for strategic focus

### Data Integration Techniques
- **Multi-table relationships**: Complex data modeling across 7 tables
- **NULL handling**: Robust data quality management
- **Alias usage**: Clean, readable query structure
- **SSN-based joining**: Secure demographic data linking
